# Whale

N.B. I don't know what I'm doing. :)

Anyway, I'm running my C++ builds in this container.

The default cmake you get from apt-get is ancient.
So, I grab the current one, unpack it and build it.
This takes a long time, so grab a beer.

I'm going to try to also install the current version of clang to mirror what I do on macOS. Not there yet.

## Feedback

Really, I just whacked this togehter.

If you are an expert and have suggestions on what to improve, I'd like to hear it.
